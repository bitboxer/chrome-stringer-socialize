# Social Add-on for Stringer

## What is this?

[Stringer](https://github.com/swanson/stringer) is a really great RSS Reader. The only
thing that is missing are a few features to third party services like 
[Readability](http://www.readability.com). 

I totally understand that those services are left out because of a design decision of
the creator, but that does not mean we can't add those features through a chrome
extension :) .

Currently this extension adds the following feature:

* Readability Text extraction

If you miss another service or feature, please send me a pull request or open
a [ticket](https://github.com/bitboxer/chrome-stringer-socialize/issues) on this repo.

## Installation

You can install this extension from the [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stringer-socialize/nbjjbkdnjmfagkikbnppocjiocbboafe).
